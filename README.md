# Ram-Ranch
2025 Hackathon
Ram Ranch
You are a farmer trying to keep your rams alive by performing healthy habits. From simple things such as brushing your teeth, to finishing a project. The more days you complete habits you can upgrade your farm and flock. If you fail, your rams suffer the consequences. You have 3 habits to complete every single day to make sure your farm stays alive. Such as brushing your teeth, eating fruits and vegetables, and going outside.
